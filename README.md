# CV Labs in Python

This repository contains Python implementations of CV  labs, which were originally developed in MATLAB. The purpose of this project is to enhance students' understanding of Python by providing an alternative to MATLAB for solving computer vision and computational imaging problems.

By translating these labs into Python, we aim to:
- Encourage learning and applying Python, a versatile and widely-used programming language.
- Promote open-source collaboration in the educational community.
